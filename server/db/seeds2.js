        info: "The Cranside Kitchen has been one of the go-to places for food, drinks and entertainment for a number of years. But do you kow the origins of the unusual Rotunda building? Built in the 1890s, the north Rotunda building (and its twin on the south bank of the river) were the entrances to the first Clyde Tunnel, preceding the current road tunnel by some 70 years. Pedestrians, horses and carts (and later motor vehicles) would be lowered by hydraulic lifts to the depth of the tunnel allowing journey underneath the river. The tunnels were still in use for pedestrians until the 1980s where they were then closed to the public. Now housing utilities, pipes and cables the tunnels still have a use over 130 years later.",

        info: "Glasgow Central Train Station is the busiest in Scotland and the second busiest outside London. The beautifal Victorian structure is Grade A listed. However, a long-forgotten village was demolished to make way for the huge building. The whole community of Grahamston was relocated from the station site and the homes, shops and theatres torn down. However, some fragments of the old village remain with Union Streets' Rennie Mackintish Hotel being one of the few survivers. Portions of the foundations of the village can also be seen during the highly-recommended Glasgow Central tour.",

        info: "Since 1842, Glasgow botanic gardens has showcased flora from around the globe. Did you know that it used to be serviced by its own train station? Opened in 1896 with station buildings at ground level, steam trains passed under the gardens' entrance making their way from the long-gone Kirklee Station to Kelvin Bridge Station in tunnel running under Great Western Road. The station closed in 1964 and the beautiful ticket office was desteroyed by fire in 1970. However, if you visit the Botanic gardens and find the station ventilations shafts near the entrance, the old station platforms are there to see, painting a picture of the bygone steam era.",

What does a unassuming cricket ground in the bustling west-end of Glasgow have to do with this you ask? On the 30th of November 1872, the very first international football match was played at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, with Scotland facing off against the yet-to-be-labelled Auld Enemy, England. The match was played in front of 4000 spectators and finsihed 0-0. The rest is history.",

Despite the buildings civic uses over the years, it isn't widely know that the neoclassical was originally built as a house for one of the merhcants of the now-named Merchant City. At a time when status meant eveything to the wealthy merchants, a tobacco merchant called William Cunninghamme of Lainshaw commissed the building as his residence. As with many of the city's merchants, Cinninghamme's fortune was made through the slave trade. Something to ponder the next time you are admiring art in the grand old building.",
